<p>
        This is Rishabh Gupta 's page and as has been wisely said &quot;Empty mind, devils workshop&quot;, well he (as in me.. talking in third person here) kind of has had an empty mind for a while with just enough devil on the plate plus it's been a while since he had one of those &quot;creative outbursts&quot; so this contribution to the mankind was long overdue. No, No, not at all, you don't have to thank him for this (pun intended, you can thank me though), he owed every individual on this planet this much, so sitback, relax and enjoy the website and beware no ones gonna be returning back here coz everything in here is full bakwas. FYI is website me maine/usne kuch bhi kahin se bhi copy nahi kiya other than wiki which has been mentioned, so we better not be getting any copyright infringement claims.. jk.. some pic previews are from the web, maybe some other stuff too (if you are offended, lemme know.. we'll take it off)! I am probably gonna be adding some actual stuff other than all this bs sometime soon, dont take my word for it though cause I am pretty sure as soon as this site is done I will burrow back into 'procrastinatious' little hole, but incase devil pesters me again I am gonna try to make and upload a couple videos for android users and for mac users, with some tips and tricks you might not have heard before, well atleast some of it for some, all for some, none for all and none for some and also some for some, oh did I forget none for some or whatever.. phew, just trying to cover all possibilities! Well.. that was all bs, prolly one of my firsts but needed to be done to bharo all the khali jagah. Oh and if you have any comments and suggestions please feel free.., to be honest I haven't yet figured out where to place the comments section so look around the site for it, but then again.. knack for reading, not my thing so be advised. Lastly tasharif ka tokra yahan laane ke liye bohot bohot dhanyawaad (imagine me/us/him bowing if you must)!</p></div><!-- Germination close -->

<h3>The day I became the school captain</h3>
<h5>Probably the proudest I have ever seen my mom, she loved being congratulated.</h5>
<div id="active"><img alt="" src="rishabh_gupta_receiving_school_flag.jpg" class="pic" style="max-width: 180px; float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 15px; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px" /></div>
<p>
        I was a kid when I had first joined this institution in class 1 and travelled through 12 golden years. In these years I was gradually and slowly moulded into what and who I am today. I owe this transformation to this institution and to my parents sitting right there (whispering thankyou mom &amp; dad!), who have not left a single stone unturned in shaping me up. All the hard work and  perseverance has helped me to bring laurels to the school and my parents. And this has given me a feeling of satisfaction as today I have the proud privilege to stand before you as the general captain of Pestle Weed College and address this august gathering with all responsibilities and commitments beside me and a whole year to transform this sanctum. It will be my constant endeavour to translate the aspirations into reality and uphold the trust bestowed upon me. I will take up the challenge to lead the students from the front and strive from perfection in every sphere.</p>
<p>
        Let me assure that my entire team of prefects is full of enthusiasm and zeal and would like to invite each pestlewanian to travel the coming journey with us, so that as the year rolls by we would have the feeling of satisfaction that we have responsibly done our jobs in the best interest of others. In accomplishing these goals I look forward to the whole hearted co-operation and perseverance of the student council.</p>
<p>
        Today we start off with this difficult but challenging journey.</p>

<h1>euthanasia. necessary evil?</h1>
<h3>All India inter school debate</h3>
<div id="active" class="demobox"><img alt="" src="rishabh%20gupta2.gif" class="pic" style="max-width: 100px; float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border-radius: 5px; border: 6px solid #000; background: none" /></div>
<p>
        There's no difference between ones killing and making decisions that will send others to kill. It's exactly the same thing if not worse.</p>
<p>
        Ever since the topic was given to me I have had sleepless nights wondering how people can advocate euthnasia. It's not just a debate it's literally about life and death and I strongly oppose the motion.</p>
<p>
        First of all let me ask you what is euthanasia?
        You must have heard about all kinds of euthanasia. But, euthanasia is not about giving rights to the person who dies, instead it is about changing public policy so that doctors and others can directly and intentionally end or participate in ending another person's life. Thus euthanasia is not about the right to die but it is about the right to kill.</p>
<p>
        I don't think that we solve the problems by getting rid of the people to whom those problems happen.</p>
<p>
        A good relationship between a doctor and a patient is based on trust. If we know that our doctor has killed as well as cured patients in the past would we really trust him without hang-ups and fears? A survey in Netherlands where euthanasia is practiced openly showed that 63% of the people in old age homes feared that their lives might end without their consent and knowledge.</p>
<p>
        Even according to religious concepts Almighty God is the giver and sustainer of life. He alone has the right to withdraw life. Life is not a right but a gift.</p>
<p>
        When a sick or elderly person asks for euthanasia how can we be sure that they are making free choice to die? How can we be sure that it is their decision and no one has persued them into it? We know that old people are afraid of being a burden to their children. Even pety things like lack of living space and expenses may all push our granny's into asking for euthanasia if it were available, because we know that they are noce people and would never want to see themselves troubling us.</p>
<p>
        Medical science and technology have made great strides in the recent years. Medical teams today have more power over life and death that it has had in the past.</p>
<p>
        Last month there was a news item about a man who had been paralysed for 14 years but one day suddenly he was able to rise and walk. There are innumerable cases like this. Let me ask you, should we give up hope?</p>
<p>
        What amazes and genuinely disturbs me is that we who consider ourselves educated and civilised are sitting here in this hall and contemplating murder. It amazes me that even after seeing how materialistic and violent the world has become we are willing to legalize a new weapon of destruction.</p>
<p>
        There was a time when tuberculosis was not curable but now it is. So we never know when man might find a cure for a disease. We never know when we might come up with a solution to relieve pain. We never know when we might find a way to bring a patient back to life.</p>
<p>
        As long as there is hope there is life and as long as there is life there is hope.</p></div><!-- Euthnasia close -->

<h1>school farewell / prom!</h1>
<h5>I got lucky with my question that night, din't deserve to be the prom king.</h5>
<div id="active" class="demobox"><img alt="" src="farewell.jpg" class="pic" style="max-width: 350px; float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 15px; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px" /></div>
<p>
        I am short of words to express the gratitude towards this great almamatar. The love and respect I have for this wonderful institution is so vast and so embedded deep inside that these few minutes of 'words of appreciation' are just skim the surface.</p>
<p>
        1993 was the year when I had stepped into the new world of Pestle Weed as a minor kid of seven. It was a home 799kms away from home. I was an innocent kid unaware of the reality of life. Gradually I went along with the rhythm of the school and stopped missing home and looked upon this family as my own. Right from class 1 just like every other kid I too had a dream of being the school caption and proper guidance and wonderful opportunities helped me attain this A1 honour that is reserved for a few.</p>
<p>
        I must say whatever I have learnt in this institution has helped me to blossom and will continue to guide me in every walk of life.</p>
<p>
        I take this opportunity to thank the principal and teachers who have always guided me on the right path and my parents who have infused in me confidence through their numerous letters of guidance and appreciation. Throughout my stay here I have always strived to come up to the expectations of the institution and gave due regards to the elders and love and affection to the youngsters</p>
<p>
        This is probably my last chance to be addressing the entire campus and let me tell you I do love giving speeches, but for it's worth I won't forget the days in Pestle Weed and the friends I had. I also take this opportunity to apologise, if knowingly or unknowingly I have ever hurt someone and would like to thank the eleventhees for going overboard with the compliment.. well not really I have been a 'Man of substance' haha.</p>
<p>
        So finally it's time I leave this institution as a legal adult. Thank you PestleWanians for all your caring gestures, specially the student body that has supported me through thick and thin. May the school prosper like I have seen for the past decade and reach the zenith of glory.</p>
<p>
        Alvida!</p></div><!-- Farewell close -->

<h3>HIT 'EM AGAIN!  HIT 'EM AGAIN!</h3>
<p>
        NDSU's sports teams are known as the North Dakota State Bison, or simply The Bison; however, they are also known as &quot;The Thundering Herd&quot;. NDSU's athletic symbol is the American Bison.
        On March 10, 2009, North Dakota State gained a bid to the NCAA Basketball Tournament in its first year of eligibility for Division I postseason play by defeating Oakland 66-64 in the Summit League Tournament Championship game.
        North Dakota State's intercollegiate sports teams participate in NCAA Division I in all sports (Division I Championship Subdivision in football). NDSU was a charter member of the Division II North Central Conference (NCC), and made the move to Division I sports in the fall of 2004. NDSU spent the next two years as an independent in Division I in all sports other than football in which it is a member of the Great West Football Conference. The school was accepted into The Summit League on August 31, 2006 and began play in that conference on July 1, 2007. The football team left the Great West Football Conference and joined the Missouri Valley Football Conference on March 7, 2007. They became a full member of the conference during the 2008 season.
        The Bison football team, which plays their home games at the Fargodome (cap. 19,287), was the winningest program in NCC history with twenty-six conference championships. A dominant force in NCAA Division II, and its predecessor NCAA College Division, they won eight national championships (1965, 1968, 1969, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1990) before moving to Division I Championship Subdivision in 2004. In November 2006, the Bison football team won their first Division I Championship Subdivision Great West Football Conference title against the South Dakota State University Jackrabbits. NDSU football is a major event in the city of Fargo and the region, averaging over 15,000 fans per home game. The men's and women's Bison basketball teams play in the Bison Sports Arena. The women's basketball team was also a dominant force in Division II throughout the 1990s. They won five titles during the decade (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996). In January 2006, the NCAA recognized NDSU's four consecutive Division II Women's Basketball Championships (1993-1996) as one of the &quot;25 Most Defining Moments in NCAA History.&quot; NDSU's men's basketball team gained national recognition in 2006 with an upset win at #13 ranked Wisconsin, and again in the 2006-07 season with a win at #8 ranked Marquette. In 2009, the Bison earned an automatic bid the NCAA tournament as winners of the Summit League.
        The Bison wrestling program has also had great success winning four Division II team titles (1988, 1998, 2000, 2001). The team is fully eligible for the Division I tournament competition. They recently joined with six other institutions to create the Western Wrestling Conference.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
        tets this The story of the development of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at NDSU parallels the history of the technological revolution that has rocked civilization during the twentieth century. It is the history of North Dakota State University and the College of Engineering and Architecture, led by Deans and Chairs with great vision and courage. It is a continuing story of dedicated faculty and staff members developing and improving programs to keep up with the &quot;real&quot; world while working under financial restraints, limited facilities and a location far from the industry it supplies with well-trained graduates. It is a story of students who became grounded in the basic fundamentals of engineering principles and proved the value of personal attention by going out and becoming successful throughout the world.</p><br />
<h3>Modern Period</h3>
<p>
        The department initiated the greatest changes and began the modernization process when Harry Speers Dixon was hired as Department Head in 1946. World War II had started a revolution in the creation of new electronic devices for communication, radar and automation. Thousands of returning servicemen had experience in radio communications, radio, remote controlled armament, automatic pilots and navigational equipment. They were eager to go to college and learn more about these new areas of human progress. Changes were to introduce two options: power and communication electronics. A solid mathematical background was maintained for the curriculum. Dr. Dixon also initiated the practice of having the departmental staff engaged in outside funded research.</p>
